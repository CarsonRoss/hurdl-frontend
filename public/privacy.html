    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 02/15/2026</p>

    <h2><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Caregiver Rescheduler ("we," "our," or "the service") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our shift coordination and SMS communication services. We provide tools for home care agencies to manage shift drops and fill-ins and to communicate with caregivers and operating directors via text message.</p>

    <h2><strong>2. Information we collect</strong></h2>
    <p>We collect and store only what is necessary to run the service:</p>
    <p><strong>Contact information:</strong> Phone numbers for agency operating directors and caregivers, and names (first and last) associated with those roles.</p>
    <p><strong>Agency and caregiver data:</strong> Information needed to coordinate shifts, such as agency name, caregiver identifiers, and similar operational details. Some of this data is received from your agency's scheduling system (AxisCare) when we send or process messages related to shifts.</p>
    <p><strong>Client information:</strong> For shift context only, we may store client first and last name and address (e.g. street, city, state, postal code) when a shift involves that client, so we can describe the shift in messages.</p>
    <p><strong>Consent records:</strong> For each phone number we text, we record whether you have consented to receive messages and when you gave consent (e.g. when you reply "YES" to our consent request).</p>
    <p><strong>Message content:</strong> When you send us an SMS, we receive the content of your message and your phone number. We use this to process your consent reply or, in supported flows, to generate a reply to you. Message content is not used for marketing or advertising.</p>
    <p>We do not collect information from you through cookies or other tracking for marketing purposes.</p>

    <h2><strong>3. How we use your information</strong></h2>
    <p>We use the information above only to:</p>
    <p>Send you SMS messages about shift drops, shift offers, and shift fill-ins when you have consented to receive them.</p>
    <p>Process your consent (e.g. when you reply YES to our consent message) and keep a record of that consent.</p>
    <p>Coordinate shifts with your agency's scheduling system (AxisCare) and update schedules when a caregiver accepts a shift.</p>
    <p>In one supported flow, generate a text reply to you using a third-party AI service that processes the message you sent; that use is only to respond to you, not for marketing or advertising.</p>
    <p>Operate, secure, and improve the service (e.g. error logging; we filter sensitive data from logs).</p>
    <p>We do not use your information for marketing, advertising, or profiling.</p>

    <h2><strong>4. No sale or marketing sharing</strong></h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We do not share your personal information with third parties for their marketing or advertising purposes. Your information is not used for marketing or advertising by us or by any third party on our behalf.</p>

    <h2><strong>5. Third-party service providers</strong></h2>
    <p>We use the following types of providers only to operate the service:</p>
    <p><strong>SMS delivery:</strong> We use Twilio to send and receive text messages. Twilio processes your phone number and message content only to deliver messages and, in one flow, to generate a reply. Twilio is not permitted to use this information for marketing or to share it for marketing purposes.</p>
    <p><strong>Scheduling system:</strong> We integrate with AxisCare at your agency's direction. Data shared with AxisCare is limited to what is needed to update schedules and coordinate shifts (e.g. caregiver and schedule identifiers). This is not for marketing.</p>
    <p>We require these providers to use the data only to provide the service and in line with this policy.</p>

    <h2><strong>6. Data retention and security</strong></h2>
    <p>We retain your information only as long as needed to provide the service and to meet legal or operational requirements. We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data and filter sensitive parameters (such as tokens) from our logs.</p>

    <h2><strong>7. Your choices</strong></h2>
    <p>You may stop receiving SMS at any time by not consenting or by contacting your agency or us. You may ask us what data we hold about you and to correct or delete it, subject to applicable law.</p>

    <h2><strong>8. Changes to this policy</strong></h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy and change the "Last updated" date. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
