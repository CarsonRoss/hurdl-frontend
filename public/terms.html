    <h2><strong>SMS Program Disclosure</strong></h2>
    <p>(Required for US Short Code / Carrier Compliance)</p>

    <p><strong>Program name:</strong> Hurdl</p>

    <p><strong>Program description:</strong> Hurdl is a shift-coordination and SMS notification service for home care agencies. When a caregiver drops a shift, we send text messages to the agency's operating director and to other caregivers to find a replacement. We also send messages when a shift has been filled. Messages are sent only to people who have opted in by replying YES to our consent request. This is an operational, non-marketing program.</p>

    <p><strong>Message and data rates:</strong> Message and data rates may apply. Charges depend on your mobile plan. Check with your carrier.</p>

    <p><strong>Message frequency:</strong> Message frequency varies. You may receive messages only when your agency uses the service (e.g. when a shift is dropped or filled, or when we need to confirm your consent). There is no fixed daily or monthly number of messages.</p>

    <p><strong>Support / Customer Service:</strong> For help or questions about this program, contact us:</p>

    <p>Email: carsonr317@gmail.com</p>

    <p><strong>Opt-out and Help:</strong> (You can text these keywords to the number that sends you messages)</p>

    <p><strong>STOP:</strong> Text STOP (or END, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE, or QUIT) to stop receiving messages. You will receive a final confirmation. After that, you will not receive further messages unless you opt back in.</p>

    <p><strong>HELP:</strong> Text HELP for help or for the support contact information above.</p>

    <p>By participating in this program, you agree to these Terms and Conditions and to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
